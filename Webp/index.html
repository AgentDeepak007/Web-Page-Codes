            <h1>Future Possibilities After Course</h1>
            <P>Bachelor in Computer Science is such course that provides a good career to the students. The field of computer science involves the study of and 
                computational systems. Computer scientist deals with software and software system which involves their theory, design, development and application.
                 In this course student learn about software programming, computer architecture, networking etc. BSc Computer Science graduates get job opportunities 
                 in many industries such as Educational institutes, Forensic Science, software development, Biotechnology, Petrochemical industry and many more. After
                  the completion of the degree student can go for masters to further enhance his skills in this field or can do a professional training course to 
                  directly join the job arena. The professional training course can be chosen according to the field of interest and the job one wants to join. 
                  The professional training involves courses like Java programmer, UX Design, Digital Marketing, Business Analytics, Data Visualization, Computer 
                  system Analysis etc. The BSc computer science graduate can get a lucrative salary package. Some of the top jobs that require BSc computer science 
                  graduates are Full stack web developer, Mobile app developer, software engineer, system administrator, system architect, Business development manager 
                  etc. Students can also go for higher education after this degree. They can opt for the courses like MSc computer science, MSc Data Analytics, MSc Data 
                  Science, and Masters in computer applications (MCA) etc.</P>
